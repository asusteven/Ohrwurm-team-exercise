Once upon a time, I was on my way to Schloss Eltz for a picnic. I packed some Apfelkuchen as a snack in my pinic basket. I brought my hund along for a walk as well.  We passed by a bratwurst stand and my hund started to run torwards it.  I bought tickets to see Rammstein live in concert next month.

Suddenly, Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte industrial metal band Rammstein stepped out of a nearby Biergarten to help me catch my hund! My hund rand into the Biergarten and almost knocked someone over.
